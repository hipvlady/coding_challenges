    "To compute the probability that a person actually has a disease after testing positive for it, we need to use Bayes' theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) Let's denote the event that a person has the disease as ``` D ``` and the event that a person tests positive for the disease as ``` T ```. We want to find the conditional probability ``` P(D|T)```, that is, the probability a person has the disease given that they've tested positive.\n",

    "- P(T|D) is the probability of testing positive given that you have the disease, which is the accuracy of the test.\n",
    "- P(D) is the prior probability that a person has the disease, which is the prevalence.\n",
    "- P(T) is the total probability of testing positive. This can be broken down into two parts: the probability of testing positive when you have the disease and the probability of testing positive when you don't. Thus, ``` P(T) = P(T|D) \\ times P(D) + P(T|D^c) \\times P(D^c) \\)```, where  ```P(D^c)``` is the probability of not having the disease and ```P(T|D^c)``` is the probability of testing positive given that you don't have the disease (this is a false positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "``` P(T|D^c) = 1 - accuracy```\n",
    "``` P(D^c) = 1 - prevalence```\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging these into the formula for  ```P(T)```and then into Bayes' theorem, we get:\n",
    "```P(D|T) = (accuracy * prevalence) \\ ((accuracy * prevalence) + (1 - accuracy) * (1 - prevalence))```\n",
